# ACG 3D Studio

Repository for the 3D studio created in the Advanced Computer Graphcis course.

## Compiling

### Bash files

The given bash files are DOS text files and must therefore be converted to a Unix text file. This can be done by executing the following command:

> dos2unix bash_script.sh

## Keyboard shortcuts

This section lists all the differnet keybinds used for navigating and using the 3D studio. A graphical user interface (GUI) will be developed which will be the primary way of navigation and transformation but these keyboard shortcuts are made for an enhanced user experience.

The keyboard shortcust are summarized in the table below.

<div align=center>

| Key        | Function                                                     | Progress    |
|:----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| W          | **Moves** camera **forward**                                 | Done        |
| S          | **Moves** camera **backwards**                               | Done        |
| A          | **Moves** camera **left**                                    | Done        |
| D          | **Moves** camera **right**                                   | Done        |

It is worth mentioning that this table is subject to change during development of the program. Therefore it is good practice to always check this table if any uncertainties occur.

## Change log

This section details the changes that occurs with each session of working on this project. After each programming session a new list with all the things that have been done and other information will be posted. This is to have a clear view of what has been done and what is needed to be fixed/added to the project.
